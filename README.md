I started by loading the dataset names as ' Superstore ' which I got from Kaggle . It contains records of customer orders , sales , profit , regions , categories and more . Initially I faced problem while loading so I used encoding='latin1' to encode some special characters that were present in the data set . 
Step two was to clean up the data set ; check for any missing values . I had to convert the sales and profit columns into full numeric data type and remove the currency symbol . 
Then I grouped the data by region , categories , segment in order to find average sales and profit , count how many orders came from each group and also get the total , average and max sales generated by the group .
In summary statistics , I printed basic data to understand it better  [ data such as mean , median , standard deviation of numeric values such as sales , profit ]
Then I have created Graphs to Visualize all the data ; graphs such as hetmap , boxplot , pairplots , histogram.
I checked which category has maximum profits and sales from the bar graph . This helped to identify which product is selling better and the profitable product types . 
I have also used plotly to make an interactive  bubble chart showing sales and profit , the size of the bubbles show the quantity and colour showed the category . Also added a scatterplot to see how discounts affect profit.
